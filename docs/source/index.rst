How to Use The WDPhotTools
==========================

To start, you're probably going to need to follow the :ref:`Installation` guide to
get WdPhotTools installed on your computer.
After you finish that, you can probably learn most of what you need from the
tutorials listed below (you might want to start with
:ref:`quickstart` and go from there).
If you need more details about specific functionality, the User Guide below
should have what you need.

We welcome bug reports, patches, feature requests, and other comments via `the GitHub
issue tracker <https://github.com/cylammarco/WDPhotTools/issues>`_.
